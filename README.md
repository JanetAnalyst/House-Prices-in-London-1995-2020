# Conclusions

Prosperous areas like Kensington and Westminster exhibit the most elevated average prices.

As one would anticipate, the dominant determinant impacting the average price is the economic affluence of the respective borough. Elevated incomes and increased employment opportunities lead to higher prices.

It is clear that average prices in London are high. It has been affected by major financial and political events (such as the Recession  Brexit, Pandemic), but has significantly increased from 1995 to 2020. 

Following the recession, there was a sharp decline in the quantity of houses sold, however average prices were not greatly impacted. Subsequently, there was a gradual rise until 2016, only to experience another decline following the referendum. 

# Future Developments

This notebook could be further improved by making some additions:

Use maps to visualise how variables in the 'yearly_dataset' vary from borough to borough.

Compare England with London (all areas) with respect to the other variables (age, life satisfaction, etc). 

Include the year as well as area (boroughs) in one visualisation.

Compare 1995 to 2020 in Pricing and number of sold homes.


# Data Overview

In our analysis, we will utilise the Housing in London dataset which is provided by Justinas Cirtautas. The dataset comprises of two csv files ('housing_in_London_monthly_variables.csv' and 'housing_in_London_yearly_variables.csv') containing extensive and relevant information. This information encompasses details such as the monthly average house prices, annual mean and median salaries for inhabitants in various areas.

The data was then imported into Excel from Kaggle.

The dataset categorises the data according to London's boroughs, although certain entries pertain to other regions within the UK, such as North East and West Midlands.
